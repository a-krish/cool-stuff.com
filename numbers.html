<h1>Do you want to know what are the largest numbers<h1/>

 <h2>lets start with 1.<br>
   it may not seem like a large number but if you multiply by 10 you get 10<br>
   after 10 we have a hundred, multiply that by hundred and you get 10 thousand then multiply it by itself and you get a hundred million like that we have 
   billion, trillion, quadrillion, quintillion, sextillion, septillion, octillion and so on..
   now lets start using (^) the exponent symbol.<br>
   there is googol 10^100 and googolplex 10^10^100<br>
   lets go higher! G64 (Grahams number), Rayo's number and Eddington's number.<br>
   But why stop there, we have TREE(3)<br>
   But there are larger numbers, Aleph-null(ℵ), the only numbers larger than aleph null are aleph-2, aleph-3 and so on
